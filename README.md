# HYG_analysis_project
Analysis and visualisation of the HYG database of stars in Jupyter

## Context
In the summer of 2025 I began my journey into data analysis with Python and Jupyter Labs, and this project was my first analysis of a large dataset. The code is messy and imperfect, but for me it represents the joy of discovery and a great learning experience. I gained a basic understanding of the distribution stars that I've enjoyed since.
